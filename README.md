🏨 Digital Guest Services System (DGSS) — Hotel Process Visualization
This project models the Digital Guest Services System (DGSS) for a hotel, visualized as a BPMN-inspired diagram using Graphviz.
It highlights the interactions between guests, kitchen staff, housekeeping staff, and an eco-friendly Green Points System.

📋 Overview
The system captures the end-to-end guest service process:

Guest initiates a service request.

Selects between In-room Dining and Laundry services.

Kitchen staff or housekeeping fulfills the request.

Guest tracks progress, provides feedback, and earns eco-points for sustainable choices.

Pools/Actors:
✅ Guest
✅ Kitchen Staff
✅ Housekeeping Staff
✅ Green Points System

Key Features:
Sequence flows and message flows clearly differentiated.

Pools represented as subgraphs.

Diagram automatically generated in .png format using Python.

📊 Output
The final BPMN-style diagram shows:

Guest journey: from request to feedback.

Parallel paths for kitchen and housekeeping services.

Eco-friendly feedback loop with the Green Points System.
